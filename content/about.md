Soypunk.me is written and produced by Shawn Medero from Claremont, California.

It contains a mixtures of full-length [posts][1], [linked items from the web][2], and [short posts][3] that are mirrored to Twitter. I mostly write about technology but occasionally will post about biking, cooking, hockey, or transit topics.

You can {{< feed-link text="subscribe to the RSS feed" >}} if you want to keep track of all updates.

I do my best to adhere to the ["IndieWeb"][4] principles and try to be a good web-citizen with clean, unbroken, and thoughtful URLs. Let me know if you find any issues.
