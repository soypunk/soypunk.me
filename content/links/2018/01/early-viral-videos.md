Randall Colburn writing for The A.V. Club:

> "We didnâ€™t used to watch everything on computer screens, but that started changing in 2003 with _"End Of The World,"_ a 90-second cartoon about nuclear annihilation that's considered by many to be the first viral video."

I stopped reading at this point because I was hung up on remembering how popular [_"Dancing Baby"_][1] became (it certainly escaped "90s nerd Internet" as I remember it being all over the television news media.) While Know Your Meme has pages for both [_"Dancing Baby"_][3] and [_"End Of The World"_][4] it does not seem to have a comprehensive timeline of so-called viral videos. (For example, I'm fairly sure [_"Star Wars Kid"_][4] pre-dates _"End of The World"_ by a few months even.)

The point of this post isn't to wag a finger at Randall for misremembering (or not knowing) Web meme history. Instead I find it a shame we don't have a commonly agreed upon source of "truth" for this type of cultural archaeology.
