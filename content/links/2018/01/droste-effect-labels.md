First a primer on [the terminology from Wikipedia][1]:

> The Droste effect (Dutch pronunciation: [drɔstə]), known in art as mise en abyme, is the effect of a picture recursively appearing within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.

And then the to meat of the content in my linked article:

> Feliks Konczakowski makes a lot of animated GIFs. In saving an animated GIF file, of course, one is given a choice. You can either specify a set number of times for the animation to play (one or more); or else you can let it continuously loop forever. (an infinite number of times) Konczakowski almost always choses infinity
>
> In some of these GIFs, he takes a dizzying dive into the recursive imaginary spaces that we call "Droste effect" packages. In some cases, he’s made both color and black & white versions which I’ve enjoyed pairing together here. (See also: Jasper Johns and Trix)

You'll have to see these GIFs to really savor them. This is the sort of whimiscal content that kept me hitting my browser's refresh button in the 2000s. Glad to see it is still around and that I've just been blind to it in the era of Twitter. (hat tip: [coudal][2])
