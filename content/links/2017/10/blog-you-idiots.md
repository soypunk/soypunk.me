Kelly Conbay, a year ago, writing about the lack of good daily blogs:

> I don’t know how we’re going to continue like this if we all have to be online all day every day. We need good things to read. We need them steadily, from people whose voices we enjoy. Short things. Commentary about a topic the writer has a greater interest in than you do. Something funny. Something very stupid. Not some big, long, boring thing, just a little thing that you read and enjoy. If aggregation, less aggregate-y.

The pendulum has mostly swung too far into the Medium/long-form direction and what daily content does exist tends to be very "listicle" in nature. I'm not sure where we lost all the great writers... probably to the Internet-hate-machine and the decline of web advertising at the blog level. While I'm not a "great writer", I know my own daily blog habit had died with Twitter.
