At this point you've probably read [Susan Fowler's "very strange year" account covering her year of working at Uber as a female engineer][2]. The comments on her blog post feature, unsurprisingly, examples of misogyny and online hassment in our culture. 

As I was going through my reading list queue, I realized that almost a year ago, [Shanley Kane at Model View Culture wrote about the SXSW Online Harassment Summit][1]:

> While it featured some compelling programming and even some great speakers, the Summit nonetheless illustrated a number of systemic problems with how we frame, discuss and address online harassment in tech.

Shanley goes on to document how narrow minded the conversations were and how it failed to present solutions that would limit online harassment. It is safe to say very little has changed in the last year.
