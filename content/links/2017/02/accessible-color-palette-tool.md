The [Accessible Color Palette Builder][1] is a web-based tool to help designers build a matrix of text and backgrounds combinations based on the [18F Color and Contrast Accessibility Guidelines][3]. For the unaware 18F is a US Government entity setup to bring "easy-to-use digital services" housed under the [General Services Administration][4]. I'm hopeful 18F will be able to ride out the political football game of the current administration transition as they've done amazing work to date. The [source and documentation for the tool is available on Github][2] as well.
