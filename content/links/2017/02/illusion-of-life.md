A primer on the basics of animation from Vincenzo Lodigiani:

> The 12 basic principles of animation were developed by the 'old men' of Walt Disney Studios, amongst them Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, during the 1930s. Of course they weren't old men at the time, but young men who were at the forefront of exciting discoveries that were contributing to the development of a new art form. These principles came as a result of reflection about their practice and through Disney's desire to use animation to express character and personality.
This movie is my personal take on those principles, applied to simple shapes. Like a cube.

Perhaps even better than the video is this [matrix of the different styles in animated GIF form on Vincenzo's companion website][1].

Stuff like this is amazingly relevant today as most user interface design now requires some form of animation yet too many of us weren't schooled in the basics before we threw ourselves into the Web and mobile apps.
