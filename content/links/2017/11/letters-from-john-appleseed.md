Giles Turnball finds a bit of tech archeology whimsy by documenting the demo emails used on Apple devices at the Apple Store:

> Who are these mysterious people who send gushing emails (and so, so many photos) to Apple’s fictional John Appleseed? Why do they go on so many trips, and have so many parties? What does John Appleseed think? I decided to work out the answer to that last one myself. I gained access to John Appleseed’s replies – curiously absent from all the demo machines in Apple Stores – to see what he sends back.
