Welcome to a pedantic series that questions editorial decision making at various journalism outlets:

**Technology Review:** ["Remotely Assembled Malware _Blows_ Past Appleâ€™s Screening Process"][1]  
"Blows" is an odd-choice of wording as I'm imaging the multi-gun shooting scene, bullet-time fun-fest from the Matrix. Nothing about the way the app was submitted was unusual. (Other than the questionable headline, this is a good and worrying story.)

**Gigaom:** ["Microsoft Outlook, SkyDrive outages hit users worldwide"][3]  
The story fails to define how many users or in fact whether ever major region was impacted or not. Worse, the story goes on to complain about Microsoft's "lack of transparency" when, compared to most services I use, I'd say the screenshots and company statements display quite a bit of transparency with outage statements and ETAs.

**ZDNet:** ["Mercedes Is Testing Google Glass Integration, and It Actually Works"][4]  
...works at what? distracting drivers even further?

**Wired:** ["Why Some Startups Say the Cloud Is a Waste of Money"][5]  
Story setups an absurd idea that cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, etc) is a "waste of money" when in-fact everyone interview says it is the right tool for the job to get your business _started_. Why was that so hard to report?

**Wired:** ["Samsung announces the Hennessy, a dual-screen, quad-core Android flip phone"][2]  
Here's a headline where someone could've totally gone batshit crazy and choose not to. Congrats, I guess?

**Wired:** ["Meet the Hackers Who Want to _Jailbreak_ the Internet"][7]  
Isn't "Jailbreak" the completely wrong term for what these folks are doing?

**Techcrunch:** ["Twitter Flexes Its Location Muscle, Tests Out Highlights Of Live Events Happening Near You"][6]  
Suppose that's one way to write a headline that fuels the brogrammer culture.
