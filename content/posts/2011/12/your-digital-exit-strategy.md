As we approach the new year, I'm thinking about resolutions for 2012. One of
my primary tech-themed resolutions is getting a better handle on my "cloud"
data. Robert Nyman, a Technical Evangelist at Mozilla, shares some reasons for
why you might want to concern yourself with ["Who Owns Your Online Life, And
Data?"](/web/20120309040218/http://robertnyman.com/2011/11/30/who-owns-your-
online-life-and-data/)

> Do you have all your mail on Gmail, appointments in Google calendar,
pictures on Picasa and videos on YouTube? Do you use Facebook to sign into
every service you use and article you comment on, on the web? All your
pictures you’ve ever taken on Flickr?
>
> A number of these companies offer these services for free. Free is a
relative term, of course, since a majority of them go through your data and
recorded behavior to present you with ads and similar information; at the same
time, it makes it a much more compelling platform for advertisers with
targeted ads. This data could, at least potentially, also be shared with third
party companies, so in essence you can never be entirely sure what and how
much a company knows about you.
>
> Many people say they are fine with sharing all the data about them, but I’m
unsure they realize just how much companies know about them. You can make a
conscious decision what to share, all the time, but always be ready that
anyone out there can access anything you ever share.

Robert points out that these companies do provide great services and there be
nothing wrong with your centering your digital life around them. Still it is
worth considering an inventory of what you use online and what your backup and
exit strategies are.

An example might be "What would it take to have a mirror copy of everything
I've put into Flickr?" It is a harder question once you dig into it. You might
say "I have a copy of every photo I've hosted on Flickr in iPhoto." That
tackles the archival of the photo material but it may not capture the
[taxonomy, geo-tagging, or even URI system-of-record
services](/web/20120309040218/http://laughingmeme.org/2010/05/18/minimal-
competence-data-access-data-ownership-and-sharecropping/) that Flickr is
providing. I'm not trying to pick on Flickr btw, I think they do an impressive
job of opening up their service. Aaron Straup Cope's ["parallel-flickr"](/web/
20120309040218/http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2011/10/14/pixelspace
/#parallel-flickr) project is a great example of what you can do.

If I could pick on anyone in the moment, it would probably be Path and their
pivot to being a "Smart Journal" provider. [Your backup or exit strategy with
Path appears to be the following](/web/20120309040218/http://service.path.com/
customer/portal/articles/257554-can-i-download-all-of-my-path-data-):

> **Can I download all of my Path data?**  
> Yes! We're happy to help you get a copy of your Path data anytime. Please send
a request to service at path dot com and we'll take care of your request.

I'm sure that'll scale awesomely when Path is bought out by some company you
aren't comfortable with. (And it is a shame because the smart journal user
experience Path is providing really is quite nice.)
