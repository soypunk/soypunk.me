Part of [documenting my Reading List library][2] will include going through 100s of items that I've been queuing up over the last several years. Kinda like wading into an old person's house and seeing years worth of newspapers stacked up everywhere -- something I'm familiar with since that was the scene I found after I visited my grandfather at his house some time ago. 

Seeing as I'm fond of having good writing music this collection of "rainy day jazz" tunes from Reddit's Jazz subreddit seems appropriate. The top voted post is a good starting point for making your own collection. To help you out I've collected 48 of the songs into a public [Apple Music playlist][9].

It is missing a few tracks that don't seem to be available on Apple Music:

* [_The Finer Things_ by Donald Fagen & David Sanborn][3]
* [_Continuum_ by Jaco Pastorius][4]
* [_Blue Champagne_ by Manhattan Transfer][5] 
* [_Ringo's Theme (aka This Boy) Version 2_ - The Skatalites][7]
* [_Josie and Truman_ - Angelo Badalamenti][8]
* _Great Northern Piano Tune #2_ - Angelo Badalamenti
* _Great Northern Piano Tune #3_ - Angelo Badalamenti

In the case of _Blue Champagne_ I found [a version by Anita O'Day][6] that I enjoyed and added to my collection as it felt at home with the more subdued sides of the recommended playlist. Right now the songs are just added in the order the poster presented them but I'll likely reorder and refine the list down over the next couple of listens.
