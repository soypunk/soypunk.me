I've long lamented that Notational Velocity’s ‘Search or Create Note’ UI workflow never made it to iOS. The developer of [FSNotes][] reached out to say it does recreate this interaction. As a bonus it also uses iCloud Drive natively! Wish it had keyboard shortcuts, guess I'll [file some issues][FSNotes-gh].
