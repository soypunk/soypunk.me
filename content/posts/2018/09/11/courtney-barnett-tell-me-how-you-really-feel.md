At the [end of Episode 12 of Michael Cot√© & Robert Brook's "Cashed Out" podcast][2] there was a lovely song playing. A quick Shazam and I was off to Apple Music where I listened to [Courtney Barnett's album "Tell Me How You Really Feel"][1]. It is an indie rock album but there's a nice bluesy undertone to it and she sings with an Australian accent which for whatever reason always lands nicely in my eardrums. (Hat tip: [@cote][3])
