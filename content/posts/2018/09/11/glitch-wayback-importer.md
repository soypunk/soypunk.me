Glitch is fascinating project for a variety reasons, sorta of a Geocities on steroids so this recent effort they've created to bring back old sites from the dead is "on brand" as the kids say:

> We’ve created the Wayback Importer. An easy way for you to grab your first website from archive.org and bring it back to life on Glitch.
It’s complete with an authentic early-web design of course — check out that cursor animation!
And we’re showcasing peoples’ first websites in a collection, alongside some classic layouts from sites like LiveJournal, Neopets, Movable Type and many other old-school ways of publishing a web page.
