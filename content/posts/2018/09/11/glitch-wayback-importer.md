[Glitch][] is a fascinating project for a variety reasons, sorta of a Geocities on steroids [so this recent effort they've created to bring back old sites from the dead][1] is "on brand" as the kids say:

> We’ve created the Wayback Importer. An easy way for you to grab your first website from archive.org and bring it back to life on Glitch.
> 
> It’s complete with an authentic early-web design of course — check out that cursor animation!
> 
> And we’re showcasing peoples’ first websites in a collection, alongside some classic layouts from sites like LiveJournal, Neopets, Movable Type and many other old-school ways of publishing a web page.

I miss still [k10k.net][k10k] which is sadly not in the Wayback Machine's archive.
