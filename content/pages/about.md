Soypunk.me is written and produced by Shawn Medero from Claremont, California. You can {{< feed-link text="subscribe to the RSS feed" >}} or {{< microdotblog-link text="follow the site on micro.blog" >}} if you want to keep track of updates.

I mostly write about technology but occasionally will post about biking, cooking, hockey, transit, or whatever else interests me.I do my best to adhere to the ["IndieWeb"][4] principles ([such as POSSE][6]) and try to be a good web-citizen with clean, unbroken, and thoughtful URLs. Let me know if you find any issues.

Finally, older content may not always reflect current views. If you don't understand something I've said, please [reach out and ask me about it][5]. I'm friendly and will respond thoughtfully even if the Internet is a less friendly place then when I joined it back in early 1990s.

I grew up in Tampa, Florida and was lucky to have been exposed to computers (such as the Vic 20) at an early age. I've spent most of my professionally career in technology and have held a number of roles as a backend-developer, front-end developer, user experience team manager, product manager, and software architect. I'm broadly interested in the history of the Web and enjoying learning about platforms that interact with the Internet. I'm not a classically trained designer but I do have an appreciation for typography, color theory, layout, and user interactions within a digital medium. I spent several years managing a multi-disciplinary user experience team and was privileged to learn from some talented individuals.

Industry wise, I've worked the gamut: small companies, large companies, internet startups, public universities, research labs, and as a self-employee consultant.

When my brain isn't churning on what to write next I enjoying reading fiction, cooking, and becoming somewhat too emotional about hockey:
